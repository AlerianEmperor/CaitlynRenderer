These images were rendered by my 10 years old laptop, if I have a new laptop or GPU, the performance will be much higher!

It's weird that Cailtyn Renderer has more than 2k clones in the past 2 years, by many different people, but only 2 stars so far (one of them belongs to me, obviously), despite being much easier to read than many real-time path tracers out there. But whatever. Apparently, I haven't uploaded anything for a while, it's not because I am lazy or not doing anything. But I have a habit of uploading a complete project and a huge chunk of code when I finish everything, that's why you won't see anything until it happenes, just like a lightning. 

Currently I am doing stuff that is way better than what I have on github, maybe I will upload it soon, so cheers.
